# Conductor Tracks

This registry lists active delivery tracks in this repository. The umbrella
release/distribution track remains the source of truth for publication,
submission, registry, and marketplace gates. `conductor/requirements.md` is the
MoSCoW requirements and contract register for the provider, publication,
registry, integration, and migration tracks listed here.

## Umbrella track

## Product unification tracks

## Provider implementation tracks

Australian provider tracks do not permit publishing, deployment, registry
submission, or stable support claims. Commonwealth is the source-backed
prerelease provider lane for search, get-work, versions, export, and MCP inside
this repo. NZ remains the only stable support lane until the umbrella release
track says otherwise.

## Publication, registry, and integration tracks

These tracks do not authorize publication, deployment, marketplace submission,
registry submission, or package/repository renaming. They define the contracts
and readiness gates each channel must satisfy before any later external action.
